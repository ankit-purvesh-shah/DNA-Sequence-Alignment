# DNA-Sequence-Alignment
Dynamic Programming Solution for Sequence Alignment

Following are the goals of the project

A. Input to Program:
1. 2 strings that need to be aligned, should be generated from the string generator (refer CSCI570_Fall2021_FinalProject.pdf).
2. Gap penalty (δe).
3. Mismatch penalty (αpq).

B. Solution should output output.txt file containing the following information at the respective lines:
1. The first 50 elements and the last 50 elements of the actual alignment.
2. The time it took to complete the entire solution.
3. Memory required.

C. Implement the memory efficient version of this solution and repeat the tests in Part B.

D. Plot the results of Part A and Part B:
1. Single plot of CPU time vs problem size for the two solutions.
2. Single plot of Memory usage vs problem size for the two solutions.
